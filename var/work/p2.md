Excellent, thank you.

Let's add two more documents.


- docs/host_from_github.md. What this one does is describe the steps to set up the DNS, Github, etc. The owner of this site may create a fresh Github account, or just use their existing, so please describe both, in case he wants to do this differently.
- docs/change_theme.md. What this one does is describe how to pick a theme, where things go in a Hugo site, etc.
