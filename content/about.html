        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1962 by a group of passionate local historians, the Lamoni Historical Association began as a grassroots effort to save important documents and artifacts that were at risk of being lost forever.</p>
        <p>What started as informal meetings in members' homes has grown into a vital community organization with a permanent facility, extensive archives, and active educational programming.</p>
