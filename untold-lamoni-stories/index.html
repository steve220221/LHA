While official records tell us about dates and events, it's the personal stories that reveal the heart and soul of our town.</p><p>From memories of childhood adventures on Main Street to recollections of family businesses that shaped our economy, these stories provide invaluable insight into what life was really like for the people who built and sustained our community.</p><p>We are looking for those who desire to share the stories of their families and stories of those who helped shape this beautiful place. Each presentation will be approximately 30 minutes in length with 15 minutes of questions and answers. If you would like to be among the first to present at this historic event, contact <b>Steven Slade at steve@lamonihistoricalassociation.org or by phone: 816.312.8536.</b></p></div><div><h3>How It Works</h3><p>Join us for two days of learning about the history of Lamoni, and the people who played an integral role in creating a place and people of peace. This coming February 27–28 2026, the Lamoni Historical Association will host the first annual Untold Lamoni Stories from the Shaw Center at Graceland University. We hope you will come out and enjoy sharing the adventures, laughter, triumphs, and the occassional missteps that make Lamoni such a wonderful place to live. As part of the foundation of the establishment of Lamoni, we will be pleased to have the Barnes family, <em>their ancestors were the earliest settlers to begin farming in what is now Ringold County</em>, as the first keynote speakers in our annual event.</p><p>We invite community members to share their memories, family histories, and personal accounts through written submissions, recorded interviews, or video testimonials. Our trained volunteers help participants tell their stories and ensure they're preserved for future generations.</p><p>All stories are archived digitally and become part of the permanent collection at the Lamoni Historical Association, where they can be accessed by researchers, family members, and anyone interested in our local history.</p><p>Now that you are sufficiently interested, and desiring to be a part of this historic event, here are the important details. To pre-register for the event, follow the link below. The cost of the event for pre-registration is $35.00 without meals, or $65.00 which includes access to Friday and Saturday plus lunch and dinner on Friday along with lunch on Saturday. Dinner will be at the Commons at Graceland University.</p><a href=# class="btn btn-outline btn-sm">Register for Untold Lamoni Stories</a></div></div></div><div id=featured-stories class=featured-section><div class=section-header><h2>Featured Stories</h2><p class=section-description>As part of this event, the Lamoni Historical Association has begun collecting the life stories of residents of Lamoni.
