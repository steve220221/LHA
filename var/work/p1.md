Excellent. Let's write some more documentation in docs:

- docs/add_registration: describe how to build a Formspree registration that can gather people's emails and interest
- docs/add_section: create a section on the site for the symposium, where people can get all the event data, register to attend, etc.
- docs/take_payment: describe how to use Square to sell tickets on the hugo site

Please include in each document a step-by-step instruction to make sure this site is easy to maintain and understand.
