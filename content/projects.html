          <p class="card-meta">Ongoing Oral History Project</p>
          <p>Our flagship initiative collecting and preserving the personal histories that make our community unique. Through recorded interviews, written submissions, and photographic documentation, we capture the stories that official records don't tell - the daily life experiences, family traditions, and personal memories that reveal the true character of Lamoni.</p>
          <p>This project invites community members to share their memories of growing up in Lamoni, running local businesses, participating in community traditions, and witnessing the changes that have shaped our town over the decades.</p>
