        <h3>Our Foundation</h3>
        <p>Lamoni was established in 1879 as a planned community, designed to embody ideals of cooperation, education, and spiritual growth. From its carefully laid-out streets to its emphasis on learning and culture, Lamoni represented a unique vision for community life in Iowa.</p>
        <p>The town quickly became known for its progressive approach to education, establishing Graceland College (now Graceland University) and fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity that continues to this day.</p>

        <h3>Celebrating Our Journey</h3>
        <p>The Sesquicentennial celebration will honor both our founding principles and the remarkable journey of growth, adaptation, and resilience that has brought us to 2029. From agricultural innovation to educational excellence, from small-town values to global connections, Lamoni's story is one of continuous evolution while maintaining core values.</p>
        <p>This milestone celebration will bring together residents, alumni, historians, and friends of Lamoni from around the world to commemorate our past and envision our future.</p>
